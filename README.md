# Online-Social-Media-Chat-App
Portfolio
This project is a social media platform such as or almost like Facebook, it allows user creation, login and logout securely in the website along with be able to find other users that are registered and either send messages or start a chat with and can also include group chat that includes both text and video or can even be private between only two users. Regarding this project I had been able to complete its full functionality except the chat part as it requires the use of an API such as pusher or the implementation of JavaScript to use python channels which will provide a better user experience rather than using normal database to create so much file load on the server.

The hard part could be described in general as the decision-making process, no matter what you had planned in advance you would face different issues that need to tackle as you proceed with the project, while the easy part as in general the more you work on different you will find quick solution to the problem at hand.
 As for the biggest achievement from this project that as a back-end developer you need to develop your skills in JavaScript, yes you can work your way around it but it will make the project more interactive as simple and it will add more functionality.
    • Future improvement:
        ◦ Show user if online or not.
        ◦ Add friend’s functionality.
        ◦ Add follower’s functionality.
        ◦ Add following functionality.
        ◦ Making channels by JavaScript.
